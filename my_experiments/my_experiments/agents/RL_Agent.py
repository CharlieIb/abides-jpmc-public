# --- Define your RL_Agent Class ---
# This is a conceptual class. In a real scenario, you'd use a library
# like Stable Baselines3, RLlib (as in the paper), or implement a custom
# agent (e.g., Q-learning, Policy Gradient, DQN from scratch).
class MyRLAgent:
    def __init__(self, observation_space, action_space):
        self.observation_space = observation_space
        self.action_space = action_space
        # Initialize your policy, Q-table, neural network, etc. here
        print(
            f"Agent initialized with obs space: {observation_space.shape} and action space: {action_space.n if hasattr(action_space, 'n') else action_space.shape}")

    def choose_action(self, state):
        # This is where your agent's "brain" decides what to do
        # Based on the current 'state', return an action.
        # For a discrete action space (like BUY/HOLD/SELL), this would be an integer.
        # For this example, let's just pick a random action as a placeholder:
        action = self.action_space.sample()
        return action

    def update_policy(self, old_state, action, reward, new_state, done):
        # This is where your agent learns from the experience.
        # Implement your learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning update,
        # neural network training for DQN/PPO, etc.)
        # For demonstration, we'll just print:
        # print(f"Agent learning: old_state={old_state[:2]}..., action={action}, reward={reward}, new_state={new_state[:2]}..., done={done}")
        pass  # Replace with actual learning logic
